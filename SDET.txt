SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) is a role that blends software development and quality assurance, requiring expertise in coding, automation, and testing methodologies. Unlike traditional QA engineers, SDETs actively participate in designing, developing, and maintaining test automation frameworks, ensuring software quality throughout the development lifecycle. They work closely with developers to identify bugs early, implement CI/CD pipelines, and enhance test efficiency using tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright. Strong programming skills in languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript, along with knowledge of API testing, performance testing, and DevOps practices, make SDETs valuable in agile and DevOps-driven environments
